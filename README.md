## Dependency
[googletrans](https://pypi.org/project/googletrans/)<br/>

## Documentation
Can be found [here](https://py-googletrans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)<br/>

## Limitations of this Library/API
1. The maximum character limit on a single text is 15k.<br/>
2. Due to limitations of the web version of google translate, this API does not guarantee that the library would
   work properly at all times. (so please use this library if you don’t care about stability.)<br/>
3. If you want to use a stable API, I highly recommend you to use [Google’s official translate API](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs).<br/>
4. If you get HTTP 5xx error or errors like #6, it’s probably because Google has banned your client IP address.<br/>
